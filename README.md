# Maze-Game
## üìñ About
Creates a maze using depth-first search with back-jumping and solves the maze using breadth-first. The program was built using python, using turtle.

There is a very simple user interface, which allows one to create an account, which is stored in a text file. Furthermore, one can customise the colours of the maze
to their own personal taste. Scores are also awarded and recorded for each player.

When the levels selection page appears, the window may not be the correct size for your computer, thus this may require manual adjustments.

The maze is drawn infront of the user; the grid is drawn first, then the maze is drawn afterwards. When the maze has been drawn, a message on the command prompt will 
appear to hit enter. Once you hit enter, the window will change in size. At the time of the project, the purpose of it was for it to be a memory game, thus the user
was expected to remember the entire path off of the top of their head and play the game, however, you may manually adjust the size of the window so that you can see the 
entire maze if you wish.

Disclosure: this program was built when I was 17 and the breadth-first algorithm will not work every time, but will work most of the time. Furthermore, the user
interface is of very poor quality, however the sole purpose of the repository is to showcase the application of the complexed algorithms to create the game. Improvements
and corrections to this project will soon be in progress.

 ## üõ†Ô∏è Setup
To run the program, open your command prompt and cd into the folder, where you cloned the program files.\
Enter the following command:
```
cd Scripts
```

Enter the following command to run the program:

```
python UserInterface.py
```
You will then be greeted with a login page. Login, or create a new account.

Continue to follow the user interface through, when you get to the level's options page, adjustment to the window size may be required.

When the program is drawing the maze, it may take a while particularly with higher levels.
